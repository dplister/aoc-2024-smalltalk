# Advent of Code - Smalltalk Edition

*Warning: I am in the process of learning smalltalk - style and appropriate idioms may not be properly followed, although I welcome issues that highlight my mistakes :)*

To run examples the following files are required:
- For `AdventFileReader.sm` create a category `AdventHelpers` and add the class `AdventFileReader`
    - The `readLines` function is a class function.

At this point you should be able to:
- copy-paste any of the specific day / part files into a Workspace window
- select all (Ctrl-A)
- print the result (Ctrl-P)
